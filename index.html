        <h2>Steph and Mark</h2>
        <p>We are really excited to be getting married on August 6th, 2011 at The Marsh in Minnetonka, MN.  We met thanks to a mutual friend (here is your shout out, Emily Arenson!) while at the University of Minnesota where Mark graduated with a degree in Computer Science and I graduated with a degree in Art.</p>
        <p>Currently Mark is working for Help Systems Inc. in Eden Prairie, and since I got a degree in Art I went back to grad school at the U of M for Special Education and will be graduating in May.</p>

        <h2>How Mark Proposed</h2>
        <p>Mark proposed on our three-year anniversary last June, while we were taking a walk around Lake Harriet.  This was after I had thwarted a few other attempts on Mark’s part to propose, such as saying no to a romantic walk around Lake Melissa while at his parent’s lake cabin, and saying no to a spontaneous trip to Duluth.</p>
